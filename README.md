Our app, Mae-Proval, assesses whether a customer is fit to buy a home or not based on their expenses and income. The data of the customer can be obtained through the user inputting each individual expense and their monthly income, or from pulling the customer's data from a database with all customers' data. The app decides whether a potential homebuyer is deemed ready to buy a home or not by calculating their Loan-to-Value (LTV), Debt-to-Income (DTI), and FEDTI (Front-End-Debt-to-Income), and validating whether these values, as well as their credit score, meet the standards of a customer financially stable enough to own a home. If certain values don't meet the criteria required, the app gives suggestions on how to improve these values.
